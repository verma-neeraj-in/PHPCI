PHPCI
=====

PHPCI is a free and open source (BSD License) continuous integration tool specifically designed for PHP. We've  built it with simplicity in mind, so whilst it doesn't do *everything* Jenkins can do, it is a breeze to set up and use.

**Current Build Status**

## What it does:
* Clones your project from Github, Bitbucket or a local path
* Allows you to set up and tear down test databases.
* Installs your project's Composer dependencies.
* Runs through any combination of the [supported plugins](https://www.phptesting.org/wiki#plugins).
* You can mark directories for the plugins to ignore.
* You can mark certain plugins as being allowed to fail (but still run.)

### What it doesn't do (yet):
* Virtualised testing.
* Multiple PHP-version tests.
* Install PEAR or PECL extensions.
* Deployments - We strongly recommend using [Deployer](http://phpdeployment.org)
